# Specification Quality Checklist: Family Tasks

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [ ] Focused on user value and business needs
- [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [ ] Edge cases are identified
- [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification

## Fidelity (constitution §VIII)

- [ ] Every requirement carries an evidence tag
- [ ] Nothing tagged `[?]`, `[INFERRED]` or `[ESTIMATED]` in the research is asserted as fact
- [ ] Every `[OURS]` decision appears in Assumptions with its date
- [ ] All nine source contradictions are resolved explicitly, with both readings recorded

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
